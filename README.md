OpenScope
=========

OpenScope - PropScope firmware and Application replacement

Application can be found in app/
Firmware in spin/
Protocol description between the 2 in doc/

!! WARNING !! Firmware compiles but has not been tried out yet !! WARNING!!

!! NOTE !! Application runs, but does not do anything yet really !! NOTE !!

Application is written in python using PyQT or PySide whichever is available on your machine. 
The UI is designed using QtCreatore so it should be possible to easily translate this in othe languages

I've tried application on both Windows and Linux. Should work under OS-X as well, but I don't
have access to a Mac. 
I want to try this out under Android, which should be possible

Look at this space for future updates
